            <h2>Python Hotel Booking System</h2>
            <p class="text">In this project, my group and I worked on an engaging project: building a Hotel Booking System using Python. The Hotel Booking System was designed to simplify booking processes for customers. It allowed them to check available rooms, make reservations, and manage their bookings effortlessly. Behind the scenes, the system handled room availability, pricing, and customer details smoothly. It also generated invoices for customers upon booking confirmation. Throughout this project, we put our Python skills to work, learning how to use loops, functions, arrays, and file handling effectively.</p>
